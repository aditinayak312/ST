        ABOUT HIS CRICKET.

    <p>
        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who served as captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[7] In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[8][9][10] He is affectionately known as Little Master or Master Blaster

            Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[15] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[16] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa.

                Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth- and second-highest civilian awards.[17] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[18][19] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[20][21] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[22] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[23] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[24] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia

                    In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[27] In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[28] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[29] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[30] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs

                            Early career
Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989,[68] after one first class season.[69] The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He made 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack.[70] In the fourth and final Test in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it.[71] In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.[72] This was later called "one of the best innings I have seen" by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.[73] In all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.[74][75] Thus Sachin Tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODIs at the age of 16 years and 238 days.[76][77]

The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests including an innings of 88 in the second Test.[78] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.[79] On his next tour, a summer tour to England of 1990, on 14 August, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved India from certain defeat in the match.[71] Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[80]

He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen.

Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."[81]

On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.[364][365][366][367] They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.

Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and has been a devotee of Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited for the first time in 1997, during the Sri Sathya Sai Unity Cup match between India XI and World XI, at the Sri Sathya Sai hill view stadium.[370][371][372] In 1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's presence.[373][374] The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations.[375][376] The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.

                                    <p>
Tendulkar's popularity has led him to be a pioneer in India on cricket business dealings when he signed a record sports management deal with WorldTel in 1995, the value of the deal being ₹300 million (US$4.2 million) over five years.[379][380] His next contract with WorldTel in 2001 was valued at ₹800 million (US$11 million) over five years.[381] In 2006, he signed a contract with Saatchi and Saatchi's ICONIX valued at ₹1.8 billion (US$25 million) over three years.[382]

Tendulkar has opened two restaurants: Tendulkar's[383] (Colaba, Mumbai) and Sachin's[384] (Mulund, Mumbai) and Bangalore. Tendulkar owns these restaurants in partnership with Sanjay Narang of Mars Restaurants.[citation needed]

Tendulkar co-owned the Kerala Blasters FC in the Indian Super League Football in association with PVP Ventures owned by Prasad V Potluri till 2017. The team has been named as Kerala Blasters after his nickname "Master Blaster".[385][386][387] He also jointly owns the badminton team Bengaluru Blasters which participates in the Premier Badminton League.[388]

In April 2012, Tendulkar accepted the Rajya Sabha nomination proposed by the President of India and became the first active sportsperson and cricketer to have been nominated.[23][416] Former cricketers Sanjay Manjrekar,[417] Ajit Wadekar, Madan Lal[418] expressed their surprise over this move. He took the oath of office on 4 June.[419] He refused to take the bungalow allotted to him in New Delhi calling it "waste of taxpayers' money" as he resides in Mumbai.[420] He met with some controversy over his attendance at Rajya Sabha proceedings.[421] In 2019, Tendulkar contributed Rs. 22 lakh from his MPLAD funds allotted to him during his stint as Rajya Sabha MP for the renovation of a Children's Park in East Bandra.[422] In the past six years as a Rajya Sabha MP, Sachin had drawn nearly Rs 90 lakh in salaries and other monthly allowances. He donated this entire salary and allowances to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. The PMO has also issued a letter of acknowledgement which states: "Prime Minister acknowledges this thoughtful gesture and conveys his gratitude. These contributions will be of immense help in providing assistance to the persons in distress

Tendulkar was one of the first nine celebrities appointed by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spread awareness regarding cleanliness and make Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) a people's movement.[424] The cricketer accepted the nomination and posted a video of sweeping a street with his friends in Mumbai.[425] In 2017, he joined hands with Aditya Thackeray and sanitation workers to clean the Bandra Fort to contribute to Swachhata Hi Seva (cleanliness is service) campaign. In 2019, he was awarded the most effective Swachhta Ambassador by India Today Group's fifth edition of Safaigiri awards for using his popularity and fame to promote cleanliness and ensure the country achieves its goal of a Swachh Bharat.[426] On the occasion of the World Nature Conservation day 2020, the cricketer took to twitter to spread message about the preservation of biodiversity.[427]

Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta.[428][429] A request by him on Twitter raised ₹10.2 million (US$140,000) through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.[430][431] Sachin Tendulkar spent nine hours on the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011 that helped raise ₹70 million (US$980,000) to ₹20 million (US$280,000) more than the target—for the creation of basic facilities, particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.
